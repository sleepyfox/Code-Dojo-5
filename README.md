Code Dojo 5
===========
This is my worked examples from the 5th meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with them. You can run the code (assuming you have node and coffeescript installed) with:

    vows --spec test-carpaccio.coffee

I set up a watchr file (code-dojo.watchr) so that the vows are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (if you have it installed) with:
    
    watchr code-dojo.watchr

The source of the kata is Alistair Cockburn and you can find the original write up [here](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Elephant+Carpaccio+exercise). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
